ELEC ENG 3108 Telecommunications Principles 
Assignment 2: Telecommunications Toolbox
Due 5pm on   Monday   18 September.   This assignment   is   worth   20%   or   30%   of your   final   grade.
Submission on   MyUni at   5pm.
What to   submit
•          Your   working   and   results
•          50% of your   marks will   be   allocated   to   discussion,   insight   and   original   experimentation   or
analysis. Your   report   is expected to   be written to a   professional   standard   and   show   original   critical   insight.
Question 1: Error Correction (15/30) 
•             Install   Matlab with the   Communications   Toolbox
(see https://www.adelaide.edu.au/technology/your-services/software/software-for-students#matlab for instructions)
•             >> doc vitdec (note the   specific   documentation   may   be   release-dependent)
•             Follow the example   code   in   the   documentation   to   explore   the   Viterbi   trellis   decoder   across   a   range of Signal to   Noise   ratios,   using   hard, quantised and   soft   decoding. You   should   also explore a small   r代 写ELEC ENG 3108 Telecommunications Principles Assignment 2: Telecommunications ToolboxMatlab

•             Note: Do use the Communications Toolbox implementation. The purpose of this question is to explore the properties of convolutional coding, rather than its detailed implementation.
Question 2: Leaky Bucket (5/30) 

Calculate the average and   peak data   rates, and   the   maximum   burst   length   (in   bytes),   of   the   following leaky bucket traffic scheduler.    Hence determine   the   time   taken   to   transmit   the   maximum-length burst.
Extension   ideas:   implement a simulation   in   Matlab, or explore variations   on   the   input   data   specifications.
Question 3: Scheduling (10/30) 

Determine the   FIFO and Virtual Clock schedules for the   following   tributaries   onto   a   single   ATM multiplex. What   proportion of the   multiplex capacity   is available for   unspecified   Bit   Rate   services?
Extension   idea:   implement a simulation   in   Matlab,   or explore variations   on   the   input   data   specifications.
